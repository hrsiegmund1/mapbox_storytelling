She is under the control of Alhponso at the start and does not know life other than her home. She endures abuse over time and the land and house becomes tied to her sense of identity and self-worth. The realization that Alphonso is not her biological father and that Celie inherited the home reveal that the home was never truly under his control. This location is integral to Celie in reclaiming her voice.",

Shug encourages Celie to see herself as more than a victim, and this contributes to Celie's journey of independence later in the novel. Their move to Memphis represents a break from the past, and the home they share becomes a space of healing and transformation. Shug encourages Celie to pursue her pants-making business. Celie begins to sell pants that she makes herself. This furthers the notion of Celie's agency as a Black woman in the novel. \"I sit in the dining room making pants after pants. I got pants now in every color and size under the sun.\" (Walker, Page 210)",

Tashi is originally resistant to cultural practices and this mirrors Nettie\'s awareness of female agency, as she write in her letters to Celie. \"Why can\'t Tashi come to school? she asked me. When I told her the Olinka don\'t believe in educating girls she said wuick as a flash, They are like white people at home who do not want colored people to learn.\" (Walker, Page 155) ',
